# NetworkManager Command Line <br>Interface (nmcli) Simplified
### (Created by TheAnonymousCrusher on Github)

The following article provides a simple documentation for the
nmcli aliases used to simplify the process of managing network
connections in a system.

# Basic Use
## 1. Connect to a Network

The nmcon alias is used to connect to a WiFi network.The
command requires the name of the WiFi network and the password
as arguments. The syntax is as follows:

```nmcon 'WIFI_NAME' password 'PASSWORD'```

For example, to connect to a WiFi network named 'Office_Wifi'
with the password 'password1234', you would use:

```nmcon 'Office_Wifi' password 'password1234'```

## 2. Disconnect from a Network

The nmdis alias is used to disconnect from a WiFi network. The
command requires the name of the WiFi network as an argument.
The syntax is as follows:

```nmdis 'WIFI_NAME'```

For example, to disconnect from a WiFi network named
'Office_Wifi', you would use:

```nmdis 'Office_Wifi'```

## 3. Show Network Status

The nmstat alias is used to display the status of all the
network devices. The command does not require any arguments.
The syntax is as follows:

```nmstat```

## 4. Show Network List

The nmlist alias is used to display a list of all the network
connections that have been established. The command does not
require any arguments. The syntax is as follows:

```nmlist```

## Conclusion

Please note that these aliases are simplified versions of
nmcli commands and are intended to make the process of managing
network connections easier and more intuitive for users.
